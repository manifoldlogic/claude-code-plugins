# Project Workflow Skill

## Overview

This skill manages the complete development workflow hierarchy:

```
Initiative (research/discovery)
    └── Project (planning/execution container)
            └── Ticket (individual work item)
```

**Key Principles:**
1. **Scripts for mechanical tasks** - Scaffolding, inventory, validation
2. **Haiku for structured processing** - Status reporting, formatting, commits
3. **Sonnet for reasoning** - Planning, review, verification
4. **Strict delegation** - Orchestrator NEVER does work itself

## Workflow Hierarchy

### Initiatives
Higher-order discovery and research work that may spawn multiple projects.

**Location:** `.crewchief/initiatives/{DATE}_{name}/`

**When to use:** Exploring problem spaces, conducting research before knowing exact deliverables.

### Projects
Planning and execution containers with defined scope and deliverables.

**Location:** `.crewchief/projects/{SLUG}_{name}/`

**When to use:** Known deliverables, ready for planning and execution.

### Tickets
Individual work items with clear acceptance criteria and verification workflow.

**Location:** `.crewchief/projects/{SLUG}_{name}/tickets/{SLUG}-{NUMBER}_description.md`

**Workflow:** Implement → Test → Verify → Commit

## Quick Reference

### Create Initiative
```bash
# Scaffold structure
bash scripts/scaffold-initiative.sh "initiative-name" "Vision statement"

# Then delegate to initiative-planner agent for content
```

### Create Project
```bash
# Scaffold structure
bash scripts/scaffold-project.sh "SLUG" "project-name"

# Then delegate to project-planner agent for planning docs
```

### Check Status
```bash
# Get ticket status as JSON
bash scripts/ticket-status.sh SLUG

# Validate project structure
bash scripts/validate-structure.sh SLUG
```

### Execute Workflow
```
For each ticket:
1. Delegate to primary implementation agent
2. Delegate to test-runner agent (Haiku)
3. Delegate to verify-ticket agent (Sonnet)
4. Delegate to commit-ticket agent (Haiku)
```

## Scripts

All scripts are in `scripts/` directory. Use these for mechanical tasks:

| Script | Purpose | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `scaffold-initiative.sh` | Create initiative folder structure | Directory tree |
| `scaffold-project.sh` | Create project folder structure | Directory tree |
| `ticket-status.sh` | Scan ticket checkboxes | JSON status |
| `validate-structure.sh` | Verify project/ticket structure | Validation report |
| `project-summary.sh` | Generate project summary | Markdown summary |

### Script Usage Examples

```bash
# Create initiative
bash scripts/scaffold-initiative.sh "api-redesign" "Redesign the public API for v2"

# Create project
bash scripts/scaffold-project.sh "APIV2" "api-version-2"

# Get status of all tickets
bash scripts/ticket-status.sh APIV2

# Validate structure
bash scripts/validate-structure.sh APIV2

# Generate summary
bash scripts/project-summary.sh APIV2
```

## Agents

### Haiku Agents (Structured, Fast, Cheap)

Use Haiku agents for tasks that are:
- Procedural with clear steps
- Pattern-matching based
- Report generation
- No complex reasoning required

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `status-reporter` | Parse script output, format status reports |
| `structure-validator` | Check file structure, report issues |
| `test-runner` | Execute tests, report results |
| `commit-ticket` | Create commits after verification |

### Sonnet Agents (Reasoning, Analysis)

Use Sonnet agents for tasks that require:
- Complex decision making
- Multi-document synthesis
- Critical analysis
- Quality judgment

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `initiative-planner` | Research and plan initiatives |
| `project-planner` | Create comprehensive planning docs |
| `project-reviewer` | Critical review of projects |
| `ticket-creator` | Generate tickets from plans |
| `verify-ticket` | Verify acceptance criteria met |

## Delegation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Script → Haiku Agent

For mechanical tasks with formatting:

```
1. Run script to gather data (e.g., ticket-status.sh)
2. Pass output to Haiku agent for formatting
3. Haiku returns formatted report
```

**Example:** Status reporting
```
ticket-status.sh → JSON → status-reporter agent → Formatted markdown
```

### Pattern 2: Sonnet Agent → Script → Haiku Agent

For complex workflows:

```
1. Sonnet agent makes decisions (what to create)
2. Script does mechanical work (scaffolding)
3. Haiku agent formats/reports results
```

**Example:** Project creation
```
project-planner decides content → scaffold-project.sh creates files → status-reporter confirms
```

### Pattern 3: Sequential Agent Pipeline

For ticket execution:

```
1. Implementation agent (Sonnet) - Does the work
2. test-runner (Haiku) - Runs tests
3. verify-ticket (Sonnet) - Verifies acceptance
4. commit-ticket (Haiku) - Creates commit
```

## Critical Rules

### DO:
- Always use scripts for scaffolding
- Delegate status gathering to scripts
- Use Haiku for formatting/reporting
- Use Sonnet for reasoning/verification
- Pass context between agents explicitly

### DON'T:
- Have orchestrator implement tickets directly
- Skip verification steps
- Use Sonnet for simple status checks
- Bypass the commit workflow
- Mix agent responsibilities

## Templates

Templates are in `templates/` directory:

```
templates/
├── initiative/
│   ├── overview.md
│   ├── opportunity-map.md
│   ├── domain-model.md
│   └── decisions.md
├── project/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── analysis.md
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   ├── quality-strategy.md
│   └── security-review.md
└── ticket/
    └── ticket-template.md
```

Scripts use these templates when scaffolding.

## Status Indicators

### Ticket Status Checkboxes

```markdown
## Status
- [ ] **Task completed** - acceptance criteria met
- [ ] **Tests pass** - tests executed and passing
- [ ] **Verified** - by verify-ticket agent
```

### Project Readiness

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Not Ready` | Critical issues blocking execution |
| `Needs Work` | Issues to address before starting |
| `Proceed with Caution` | Risks identified, can proceed |
| `Ready` | Well-defined, ready for execution |

## Integration with Commands

Commands in the `commands/` directory provide user-friendly interfaces:

| Command | Delegates To |
|---------|--------------|
| `/initiative-create` | scaffold-initiative.sh + initiative-planner |
| `/project-create` | scaffold-project.sh + project-planner |
| `/project-review` | project-reviewer agent |
| `/project-tickets` | ticket-creator agent |
| `/project-work` | Sequential ticket execution |
| `/ticket` | Single ticket workflow |
| `/status` | ticket-status.sh + status-reporter |
| `/archive` | structure-validator + archive logic |

See [references/workflow-overview.md](references/workflow-overview.md) for detailed diagrams.

## Agent Responsibilities

See [references/agent-responsibilities.md](references/agent-responsibilities.md) for detailed agent descriptions.

## Best Practices

### Efficiency
1. Use scripts for data gathering before spawning agents
2. Prefer Haiku when reasoning isn't needed
3. Batch status checks rather than per-ticket queries
4. Cache project context across ticket executions

### Quality
1. Never skip verification steps
2. Always run tests before verification
3. Use project-reviewer before ticket creation
4. Keep commits atomic (one ticket = one commit)

### Maintainability
1. Follow naming conventions strictly
2. Keep tickets at 2-8 hour scope
3. Document decisions in projects
4. Archive completed projects promptly
